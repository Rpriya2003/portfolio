# portfolio
Create a personal portfolio site.

This program creates a small personal portfolio website using Flask, a Python web framework. It has two main parts:

1. In app.py, we define routes like / for the homepage and /contact for the contact page. Flask listens for these routes and shows the right HTML page.
2. The templates folder contains index.html with your personal information and contact.html with a form where visitors can send you messages.
3. Contact Form â€“ When someone fills the form and submits it.
